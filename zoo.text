## Elephent
Elephants can be found in various captive facilities such as a zoo, sanctuary, circus, or camp, usually under veterinary supervision.

## Giraffe
A zoo is no place for giraffes, where these complex, social, wide-ranging, browsing animals are subjected to a life of social deprivation, environmental restrictions, and inadequate nutrition. As a result, giraffes in zoos frequently suffer compromised health and stereotypic behaviors

## lions

Lions in zoos may live into their late teens or early 20s. In the wild, a lioness may live up to 16 years, but males rarely live past the age of 12
