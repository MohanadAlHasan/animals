Dogs:
Most dogs are comfortable being petted on the chest.

Cats:
While some cats hate their own kind and must be the household's only pet, feral cats form colonies, and many pet cats befriend each other. â€œThey have several complex social and cooperative behaviors such as caring for each other's young
 Rabbits :
 
Rabbits are social animals, so a single rabbit is likely to feel lonely and depressed. Rabbits can live alone, but you'll need to provide your pet with the attention (company, petting, grooming, exercise, playing, and enrichment) that a bonded rabbit partner would provide.
